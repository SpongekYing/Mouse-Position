# Mouse-Position

Hi, KY here.

This is a Mouse Position App that displays the position of the mouse cursor on the screen in real time. The app provides a simple interface where users can simply move the mouse to any location on the screen and immediately see the X and Y values for that location. This can be very useful for developers, designers, or anyone who needs to pinpoint where the mouse is. You can use this application to measure and record the position of the mouse on the screen and apply it to your project or test.
